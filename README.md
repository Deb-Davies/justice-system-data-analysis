# Justice System Data Analysis

This project is an **in-progress structured analytics workflow** for justice system incident data.  
It focuses on identifying patterns in offender demographics, crime context, and system response, using **SQL**, **Python**, and statistical modeling.

## Goals
- Model incident-level justice data in a normalized relational database
- Perform modular SQL queries for offender and crime context analysis
- Create reproducible Python-based visualizations and reports

## Current Status
- âœ… Database schema design completed
- âœ… Core SQL join logic implemented
- âœ… Initial Python visualizations generated
- ðŸ”„ Additional statistical modeling and dashboarding in progress

## Technologies
- SQL (SQLite)
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Relational Data Modeling

## Draft Notebook
- [Justice Data Analysis Workflow (NCVSdata.ipynb)](notebooks/NCVSdata.ipynb)
